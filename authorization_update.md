# Authorization Update: Granular Action-Level Sub-Permissions

This document presents the **Present State** of permissions in the system, defines proposed **Granular Action Sub-Permissions** for every section, and details the **New State** of backend role-based authorization.

---

## 1. Present State (Section-Level Blanket Permissions)

Currently, the system uses **17 main section-level permissions**. Holding a section's main permission grants full access (View, Create, Edit, Delete, Process) to all endpoints within that section.

| Section / Module | Main Permission String | Current Access Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Member Management** | `member_management` | Full member CRUD, documents, family records |
| **Member Financials** | `member_financial_management` | View invoices, record payments, fees, dues |
| **Restaurant Operations** | `restaurant_management` | View menu, edit items, create orders, billing |
| **Outlets (Bar/Tea/Cigar)** | `outlet_management` | View items, cross-ordering rules, order billing |
| **Reservations** | `reservation_management` | Resource slots, booking creation, advance payment |
| **Facility Management** | `facility_management` | Facility definition, status toggles |
| **Event Management** | `event_management` | Event planning, registrations, expenses |
| **Attendance Management** | `attendance_management` | RFID cards, check-in/out logs, guest management |
| **Payroll Management** | `payroll_management` | Salary structures, payroll runs, payslips, loans |
| **Vendor Management** | `vendor_management` | Vendor offers, contract selection, vendor payments |
| **Activity Logs** | `activity_log_management` | System user activity logs |
| **Group & Permissions** | `group_permission_management` | Group CRUD, permission assignment |
| **Employee Onboarding** | `employee_onboarding` | Staff user registration |
| **User Access** | `view_all_users` | View all users list and details |
| **Bulk Emails** | `bulk_emails_management` | Email sending and logs |
| **Product Management** | `product_management` | Product inventory and items |
| **Promo Codes** | `promo_code_management` | Promo code creation and discounts |

## 2. Proposed Granular Action Sub-Permissions (Action Scopes)

To enable precise backend authorization enforcement (e.g., allowing a user to `view` or `create_order` without allowing them to `delete` or `edit_menu`), we define granular action sub-permissions using formatted string namespaces (`section:action`):

## 3. New State (Granular Hybrid Authorization Architecture)

In the updated state, the authorization architecture operates as a **Hybrid Model**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[Staff User] --> AssignGroup[AssignGroupPermission]
    AssignGroup --> Group[GroupModel: e.g. Restaurant Staff]
    Group --> Perms[PermissonModel Set]
    
    Perms --> MainPerm[Main Section Permission: restaurant_management]
    Perms --> SubPerm1[Sub Permission: restaurant:order_create]
    Perms --> SubPerm2[Sub Permission: restaurant:kitchen_update]

    MainPerm --> FE[Frontend: Controls Navigation & Menu Visibility]
    SubPerm1 --> BE1[Backend Endpoint: POST /api/restaurant/orders/]
    SubPerm2 --> BE2[Backend Endpoint: PATCH /api/restaurant/orders/status/]
```

### Key Highlights of the New State:
1. **Frontend Boundary (Main Section Perms)**: Frontend applications continue checking main permissions (e.g., `restaurant_management`) to toggle high-level navigation tabs, dashboards, and module routes.
2. **Backend Enforcement (Action Sub-Perms)**: API endpoints enforce specific action permissions. If a staff user has `restaurant:order_create` but lacks `restaurant:billing`, they can place orders but cannot bill them.
3. **Flexible Role Customization**: Administrators can create custom groups in `GroupModel` with any combination of main and sub-permissions to fit exact organizational hierarchies.

## 4. Frontend Integration Workflow & UI Component Visibility Control

To deliver a production-grade web application experience, the frontend mirrors the backend's hybrid authorization model through five integrated UI control mechanisms:

```mermaid
graph TD
    UserAuth[User Authenticated Session] --> FetchPerms[Fetch User Permissions Array]
    FetchPerms --> Cache[React Query Cache / Stale Time 5m]
    
    Cache --> RouterGuard[Middleware & Protected Sub-Routes]
    Cache --> SidebarFilter[Recursive Navigation & Sub-Item Filter]
    Cache --> ComponentGuard[PermissionGuard UI Wrapper]
    Cache --> Hook[usePermissions Custom Hook]

    RouterGuard --> Redirect[Redirect to /unauthorized if unpermitted]
    SidebarFilter --> HideNav[Hide unpermitted sidebar items & sub-links]
    ComponentGuard --> HideUI[Hide action buttons, forms & table columns]
```

### Frontend Implementation Modules:

1. **Central Sub-Permission Registry (`src/lib/component_permissions.ts`)**:
   * Contains `sub_protected_routes` for direct sub-path checking.
   * Exports `UI_ACTION_PERMISSIONS` constants (e.g., `MEMBER_CREATE`, `MENU_EDIT`, `LOG_EXPORT`).
2. **Global Custom Hook (`src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`)**:
   * Exposes `hasPermission(permissionName)` and `hasAnyPermission(list)`.
   * Evaluates exact sub-permissions, master section fallbacks (e.g., `member_management` unlocking all `member:*` actions), and superadmin overrides (`isAdmin`).
3. **Declarative Component Guard (`src/components/common/PermissionGuard.tsx`)**:
   * Protects individual UI elements (buttons, forms, action icons).
   * Usage: `<PermissionGuard permission="member:create"><Button>Add Member</Button></PermissionGuard>`.
4. **Recursive Navigation Filter (`src/components/utils/Navigation_functions.tsx`)**:
   * Maps sub-navigation labels (e.g., "Add Member", "View Members", "Add restaurant item") to exact sub-permissions.
   * Recursively filters out unpermitted sub-links; if an entire section has 0 allowed sub-items, the section header is automatically hidden.
